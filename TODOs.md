### TODOs for a successful day today

~~* Build front end + backend into a single docker image~~
* Front end needs to grab token from local storage and automatically login user if their token is valid
* Everything works when you run the docker image (difference between running locally vs. running in a server somewhere, make sure both works)
* Look into client path vs. server path
