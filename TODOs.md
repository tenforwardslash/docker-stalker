### TODOs for a success


* Front end needs to grab token from local storage and automatically login user if their token is valid
* Look into client path vs. server path (this what causes the bug of typing in path vs. GOING to path)
~~* Build front end + backend into a single docker image~~
~~* Everything works when you run the docker image (difference between running locally vs. running in a server somewhere, make sure both works)~~
